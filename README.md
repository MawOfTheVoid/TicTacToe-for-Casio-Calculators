# TicTacToe-for-Casio-Calculators
A simple TicTacToe game for your Casio calculator.
It should run on all of the fx series calculators but it wont hurt to try it on others.

It was my first very own project and therefore I believe it should have this special spot.
You can place your X with the 5,6,*,2,3,+,.,exp,(-) Buttons.

To put this file on your calculator you have to use the CASIO FA-124 application.
Have fun!
